# Learning goals

##Description:
Short selling statement:

Katie is a creative, flexible, and resourceful problem solver who brings positive energy and Canadian-ness to the project team.

Slightly longer technical statement:

Katie has been programming for several years, focusing on java core and android. She is now concentrating on learning full-stack web application technologies and has demonstrated proficiency in ruby, sinatra, rails, and javascript.

##Learning Objectives:
* I will learn data structures because they will help me in the technical interview
* I will learn design patterns because it will help me write better code
* I will learn databases because it will help me make informed design decisions
* I will learn sinatra because I want to deliver software as a service
* I will learn metrics for code efficiency because it will help me refactor effectively
* I will write a new language because it is hard

## Projects
* I will demonstrate my knowledge of data structures, design patterns, and metrics with examples from Ruby Quiz
* I will demonstrate my knowledge of sinatra and rails with JSGames

##How I want Chuck to measure my success:
1. I will have learned data structures when I can show a project that implements two data structures.
2. I will have learned design patterns when I can show a program that is properly refactored into single purpose classes and methods
3. I will have learned sinatra when I have deployed a project that uses routes, ruby, javascript, html, css, rspec, jasmine, capybara, postgres
4. I will have learned how to write a language when I have built a "Hello World" project in that new language

##Rough schedule by week:
* Week 9 - Animal Quiz (BST, ruby, ajax, RSpec, yaml)
* Week 10 - Amazing Mazes (ruby, priority queue)
* Week 11 - Solitaire Cipher (ruby, sinatra, ajax, jasmine, metrics)
* Week 12 - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (ruby, json, serializable)
