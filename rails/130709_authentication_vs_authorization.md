# Authentication vs authorization
authentication allows us to identify users of our site, and authorization lets us control what they can do

implement a security model that requires users to be signed in and prevents them from updating any information other than their own. Users who arenâ€™t signed in and who try to access protected pages will be forwarded to the signin page with a helpful message
