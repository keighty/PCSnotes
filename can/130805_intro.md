# Intro

Name: CAN

dynamic
similar to ruby, python, cucumber
written in ruby

### Parts of language
1. lexer
2. parser
3. interpreter
4. runtime

### Rules for CAN
* blocks of code are delimited by indentation
* classes are declared using "A" keyword
* methods are defined using "CAN" keyword
* lowercase identifiers are local variables or method names
* capitalized identifiers are global variables
* no parens for args
* last value evaluated in return value
* everything is an object

1. This code has to be provided as input to a lexer.
1. The lexer will convert that input into tokens.
1. Those tokens are going to be used by a parser.
1. The parser will organize those tokens into a structure.
1. That structure will be a tree of nodes.

* The parser simply determines how the language can be structured.
* A runtime is what allows that structure to execute.
* In order for a runtime to work, you have to evaluate the nodes.
* An interpreter is what evaluates any code that was passed to it.
* The interpreter reads the syntax tree (from the parser) and executes each action associated with a node (from the runtime)
