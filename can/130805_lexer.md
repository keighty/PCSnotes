# Lexer

Converts input into tokens. Can be done using REGEX, or using a LEX

input = code to execute
```bash linenos
print "I ate",
  3,
  pies
```
Becomes...
tokens = blocks for parser
```bash
[IDENTIFIER print]  [STRING "I ate"] [COMMA]
                    [NUMBER 3]       [COMMA]
                    [INDENTIFIER pies]
```

###LEX
Lex reads an input stream specifying the lexical analyzer and outputs source code implementing the lexer in the C programming language.
Examples include Rex (Ruby), JFlex (Java)

YACC uses the Shunting Yard algorithm (the shunting-yard algorithm is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation.)

###Using Regex
Tokenizing
```python
if tasty == True:
    print "Delicious"
```
yields:
```bash
[IDENTIFIER if][IDENTIFIER tasty] [EQUAL] [IDENTIFIER TRUE]
[INDENT] [IDENTIFIER print] [STRING "Delicious"]
[DEDENT]
```
